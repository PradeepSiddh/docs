In this project, We will create a "Local.sol" smart contract using Remix IDE(https://remix.ethereum.org/), Javascript, Solidity. We will deploy our smart contract to QuickNode using Ethereum Georli as our test network.

## Prerequisite

   1. Metamask should be installed. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/202666076-3fee7f9e-6e6b-4c7b-b010-061704fb192c.png">
      And set up your metamask account. Also remember in mind to **"Safe the Seed Phrase"**.
   2. Now, to deploy our contract we need some test ether for this go to the Georli Faucet(https://goerlifaucet.com/) <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/202674323-0df42f3e-81f9-4585-9743-d1d46ca62aa0.png">.
   3. And ask some test ether by giving your metamask address. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/202674809-5bcd8954-c32e-4b8c-998d-191b89416662.png">

## Writing our Smart Contract

  1. Now we will go to Remix IDE and write our contract.
  -  And go to the "create a new file".
  -  Name your file. 
  -  Write down the contract. It will look like this <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/202678545-61fd6a28-3ed5-48d0-93bc-01e12cee3cea.png">
  -  After this compile it. And after it will show compile sign like as shown in above fig. 
  -  Now we will deply it. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/202679199-3df55fe5-b8dd-449d-a245-0eaafc10efa7.png">
  -  When we will deploy it a popup will appear for transaction like this <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/202680068-74350bc5-1a38-4228-836a-bf6fb31a347d.png">. And after confirm it our contract had been succcessfully deployed.


To check our deployed contract we will go to the Etherscan(https://etherscan.io/). <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/202693772-aa77d6bc-d83c-4c8f-8ba9-61e0432271dc.png">

Thanks a lot for reviewing my submission and for building EarnWeb3!
