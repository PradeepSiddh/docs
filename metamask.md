#   Overview
The XDC Network(https://xdc.network/) is attracting the projects and community towards itself with its "lowest gas fee" and "high-speed transaction" which is "2000+ TPS". Most of the people are interested in the XDC Network but currently, they are using Ethereum Network.

So BlocksScan(https://blocksscan.io/) is introducing a new RPC which will help us to handle both the transaction, functions without changing any code or we can say smart contract.

In this guide, we will show you how to set up Metamask for BlocksScan RPC.

##  What is Metamask?
    
MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that enables users to access the Web 3 ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps).    

 #In brief:
 
   - MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that enables users to store Ether and other ERC-20 tokens.
   - The wallet can also be used to interact with decentralized applications, or dapps.

The decentralized internet, Web3, is built on a foundation of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dapps). But in order to use them, you need a user interface. Ideally, an elegant, intuitive, easy to use interface.

MetaMask is one of the leading crypto wallets, and relies on browser integration and good design to serve as one of the main gateways to the world of Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs.

MetaMask(https://metamask.io/) is a browser plugin that serves as an `Ethereum` wallet, and is installed like any other browser plugin. Once it's installed, it allows users to store Ether and other `ERC-20` tokens, enabling them to transact with any Ethereum address.

By connecting to MetaMask to Ethereum-based dapps, users can spend their coins in games, stake tokens in gambling applications, and trade them on `decentralized exchanges (DEXs)`. It also provides users with an entry point into the emerging world of decentralized finance, or `DeFi`, providing a way to access DeFi apps such as "Compound" and "PoolTogether".


###  How to get started using MetaMask

Though it might seem complicated to beginners, MetaMask is one of the simpler Ethereum wallets and dapp browsers to use, and can be set up in a couple of minutes in most cases.

To use MetaMask, you will need either Chrome, a Chromium-based browser such as Brave, or Firefox.

First, you need to download Metamask Extension(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn):

</p>

After, downloading it, open it and `Get Started`.

</p>

###  Create a MetaMask Wallet or Import it from Secret Recovery Phrase

Now, click the `Create a Wallet` button. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/195863927-9198461e-3db5-4e34-b8e4-66442f7ffe36.png">

You’ll then be asked if you want to help improve MetaMask. Click ‘No Thanks’ if this doesn’t interest you, otherwise click ‘I agree’. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/195864243-ae0dca13-42db-46b1-a5bb-1975f0c6b700.png">

Pick a password on the next step. This needs to be at least 8 characters long. I recommend using a completely unique password that hasn’t been used anywhere else, and one that contains a mixture of upper and lower case letters, symbols, and numbers. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/195864579-7a6d2a90-a54b-4f93-94fe-b63aa7e0b51a.png">

Read and accept the Terms of Use, and click ‘Create’ once your password has been set.

MetaMask will then present you with your 12-word backup phrase. You’ll need to write this phrase down carefully, with the words recorded in the same order displayed on your screen. This phrase will be needed to recover your wallet should you ever lose access to your computer, and should be kept stored somewhere safe. Anybody who has access to your 12-word backup phrase will have access to the funds in your MetaMask wallet, so keep it private.

Click ‘Next’ once you’ve written this down.

</p>

Confirm your backup phrase on the next screen by entering the words in the same order saved previously. Click ‘Confirm’ once done.

</p>

You have now almost completed the MetaMask setup process. Just click ‘All Done’ on the final page, and you will be automatically logged in to MetaMask.

If you ever get logged out, you’ll be able to log back in again by clicking the MetaMask icon, which will have been added to your web browser (usually found next to the URL bar).

###  Setup MetaMask to connect to BlocksScan RPC

Switch the connected Network by clicking on the tab “Ethereum Mainnet” Network.

Now we are adding the `Custom RPC` using `BlocksScan RPC` <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/195867214-71ed6871-86f5-45b6-b69a-31164261a3dd.png">

By clicking on the “Ethereum Mainnet” you will find the “Add Network” button. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114388943/195867422-2249e063-13ed-4563-a853-327ce10bc985.png">

Now enter the details about `BlocksScan RPC` settings:

**`NOTE`**

While using Metamask for the XinFin Network, your address prefix will be `‘0x’` instead of `‘xdc’`.

Before sending any transaction, please check the Address prefix and amount carefully.

For new users, I would recommend you to start the transactions with small amount.
